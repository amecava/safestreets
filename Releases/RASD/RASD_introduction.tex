\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of a \textbf{R}equirement \textbf{A}nalysis and \textbf{S}pecifications \textbf{D}ocument is the process of discovering the purpose for which a software system was intended, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation. \cite{RE} It is also concerned with the relationship of software's factors such as goals, functions and constrains to precise specifications of software behavior, and to their evolution over time and across software families.\cite{Zave}

\subsection{Scope}

SafeStreets is a crowd-Â­sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations occur, and in particular parking violations. 

The application allows users to send pictures of violations, including suitable metadata, to authorities. Examples of violations are vehicles parked in the middle of bike lanes or in places reserved for people with disabilities, double parking, and so on. In addition, the application allows both end users and authorities to mine the information that has been received, for example by highlighting the streets (or the areas) with the highest frequency of violations, or the vehicles that commit the most violations. Of course, different levels of visibility are offered to different roles.\cite{Assignments}

\subsubsection{Goals}
	\label{sec:goals}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}]
		\item \label{goal:register} Allow guest users to register to the system
		\item \label{goal:login} Allow registered users to authenticate to the system
		\item \label{goal:provideData} Allow users to provide data: upload a picture, specify the type of violation and possibly the street in which the violation occurred
		\item \label{goal:retrieveData} Allow users to consult previously received data served with different levels of visibility based on their role
		\item \label{goal:connectMunicipality} Cross SafeStreets data with information about the accidents that occur on the territory of the municipalities to identify potentially unsafe areas, and suggest possible interventions
		\item \label{goal:avoidLeaks} Ensure that the chain of custody of the information provided by the users is never broken, and the information is never altered or manipulated
		\item \label{goal:ticketsInformation} Access the municipality archives of emitted tickets and build statistics based on the retrieved information
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Glossary}
	\subsubsection{Definitions}
	\begin{description}
		\item[System:]the SafeStreets software we are to develop
		\item[Municipality:] a city, a town or a village, or a small group of them
		\item[Local authorities:] the local authorities of the municipality for example the local police
		\item[Guest \emph{or} Guest user:] person who access the system as non logged user
		\item[Logged user \emph{or} Authenticated user:] authenticated person who is interfacing with the system
		\item[Super user:] authenticated municipality who is interfacing with the system that has higher privileges and visibility of data than a standard logged user
		\item[User:] guest user or logged user
		\item[Registration:]  interaction between a non registered user and the system in which the user, providing all of the information required by the system for the creation of an account, receives from the system the credentials needed to authenticate to the system
