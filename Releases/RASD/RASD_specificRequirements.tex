\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The following requirements are derived in order to achieve the specified goals.
\subsubsection{Goals}
	\begin{description}
		\item \ref{goal:register}\ Allow guest users to register to the system
			\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{R\arabic*}]

  				\item The system must require the \emph{guest} user to insert an e-mail address
  				\item The system must require the \emph{guest} user to his personal ID to verify his identity
   				\item The system must check that the username inserted by the \emph{guest} user doesn't belong to another user already registered to the system 
   				\item The system must check that the password inserted by the \emph{guest} user satisfies the security constraints for a strong passphrase 
   				\item The system must check that the e-mail address inserted by the \emph{guest} user doesn't belong to another user already registered to the system
   				\item The system must check that no user is already registered using the ID inserted by the \emph{guest} user 
   				\item The system must check that the email inserted by the \emph{guest} user exists and belongs to him sending him a verification e-mail
   				\item The system must allow the \emph{authority} user that needs to register to service to request an account
   				\item The system must provide a specific username and password to the \emph{authority} user that needs to register to service 
   				\item The system offers an interface that allows the user to modify or update his e-mail address or password (username and ID cannot be changed)
  			\end{enumerate}
		\item \ref{goal:login}\ Allow registered users to authenticate to the system
			\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
  				\item The system must require the user to insert his username and password to authenticate to the system
   				\item The system must be able to check if the username and password pair
   				correspond to a user correctly registered to the system
   				\item The system must allow access to a user if username and password inserted corresponds to a user correctly registered to the system
   				\item The system must allow access to the services provided by the system only to authenticated users that and have confirmed their own e-mail address
			\end{enumerate}
		\item \ref{goal:provideData}\ Allow users to provide data: upload a picture, specify the type of violation, manually insert the licence plate number and possibly the street in which the violation occurred
			\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
				\item The system must require the user to login in order to allow him to provide data
				\item The system must require the user to upload a picture of the vehicle subject of the violation
  				\item The system must allow the user to manually insert the license plate number in order to help the recognition algorithm
  				\item The system must be able to retrieve the license plate of the vehicle running an algorithm to recognise it
  				\item The system must be able to verify that the license plate number is valid and registered to a vehicle
  				\item The system must require the user to specify the type of violation
  				\item The system must allow the user to provide the location of the violation, manually specifying the address, picking it up from the map or using the GPS of the device
   			\end{enumerate}
		\item \ref{goal:retrieveData}\ Allow users to consult previously received data served with different levels of visibility based on their role
			\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
   				\item The system must require the user to login in order to allow him to consult information about previous violations
   				\item The system must allow the authenticated user to request summary information on the past violations
   				\item The system must allow the authenticated authority to request detailed information on the past violations
   				\item The system must be able to provide the requested information to user
   				\item The system must allow the user to consult the requested violations information
  			\end{enumerate}
		\item \ref{goal:connectMunicipality}\ Cross SafeStreets data with information about the accidents that occur on the territory of the municipalities to identify potentially unsafe areas, and suggest possible intervention
			\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
   				\item The system must be able to retrieve data about accidents from municipality systems 
   				\item The system must be able to process data retrieved from municipality
   				\item The system must be able to elaborate accidents and violations information to extract data about unsafe areas
   				\item The system must be able to provide data to municipality systems to suggest possible interventions to increase safety in a specific area
  			\end{enumerate}
  		\item \ref{goal:avoidLeaks}\ Ensure that the chain of custody of the information provided by the users is never broken, and the information is never altered or manipulated
  			\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
  				\item The system must adopt security measures to prevent malicious accesses and to protect sensible data
   				\item The system must provide a secure channel to communicate with the users
   				\item The system must encrypt the connection with the users in order to protect the process of providing data
  			\end{enumerate}
  		\item \ref{goal:ticketsInformation}\ Access the municipality archives of emitted tickets and build statistics based on the retrieved information
  			\begin{enumerate}[resume*] 
  				\item The system must be able to retrieve data about tickets issued by the municipality 
   				\item The system must be able to process data retrieved from municipality
   				\item The system must be able to elaborate issued tickets information to generate statistics about useful violations provided by users
   			\end{enumerate}
   	\end{description}
  	
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	The system should ensure acceptable response times in the interactions with the user, which strictly depends on the number of concurrent users and the connection speed.
\newline
The processes of providing data and loading the map of safe and unsafe areas shouldn't be too slow.
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
	\subsubsection{Availability}
	The system must be available 99,9\% of the time (up to 8,76 hours per year of downtime). The system should be accessible 24 hours per day.
	\subsubsection{Security}
	Users personal information and payment information are encrypted and must be protected during transmission, as already stated the PTPP protocol will be used to ensure encryption through the network.
	Restricted access APIs must check that who tries to use them is actually allowed to do so.
	\subsubsection{Portability}
	The system must be also accessible by the most common mobile platforms (iOS and Android devices).
