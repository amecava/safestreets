\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interfaces}

\subsubsection{System Interfaces}

\paragraph{Municipality Data Exchange} The definition of the municipality data exchange interface is dependent to the corresponding SafeStreet's interface required to be offered to the municipalities. The municipality is required to offer the following functionalities to the system:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item guarantee a secure authentication to the municipalities' system using a provided \emph{restricted access API}
		\item provide a secure transfer of data related to accidents occurred in the territory of the municipality
		\item provide a secure transfer of data related to local authorities' issued tickets 
	\end{itemize} 
	
	Leveraging the retrieved municipality data the system is required to cross this information with the system previously stored data. In addition, the system is required to perform the following functions on the crossed data:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item build statistics on the frequency of violations
		\item build statistics on the vehicles that commit the most violations
		\item build statistics on the most egregious offenders leveraging the issued tickets data
		\item build statistics on the effectiveness of the SafeStreets initiative by looking for trends in the issuing of tickets
		\item identify potentially unsafe areas and store this new generated information 
		\item identify possible interventions to be suggested to the municipalities and store this new generated information 
	\end{itemize}
		
	To fulfil the bidirectional data exchange the system is required to offer the following functionalities to the municipalities:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item guarantee a secure authentication to the system using a provided \emph{restricted access API}
		\item provide a secure transfer of data related to user uploaded violations and all the corresponding metadata
		\item provide a secure transfer of data related to possible interventions suggestions 
		
	\end{itemize} 
	
\clearpage

\paragraph{Geographic Information System} The definition of the external GIS interface is GIS dependant and will be described in a functionality-based way. The system is required to perform the following functions:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item load and filter data based on the user requested criteria
		\item cache retrieved data for the most common user requested criteria
		\item communicate the loaded and filtered data to the external GIS with the final goal of presenting the requested map to the user via the user interfaces
		
		\end{itemize}
	
	The system via the external GIS is required to be capable of handling the following data visualisations:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item visualise the spatial location of stored violations inside a specific geographic area requested by the user
		\item visualise the spatial location of stored violations inside a specific geographic area and a specific time range requested by the user
		\item visualise the distinction between possible safe and unsafe areas identified by the system
		\item map quantities and concentrations, such as where the most and least number of violations occurred, highlighting the streets (and areas) with the highest frequency of violations
		\item map the change of quantities and concentrations inside a specific geographic area and a specific time range requested by the user
	\end{itemize}

				\item The system must allow the user to take a picture of the violation and the plate from the mobile application
  				\item The system must allow the user to manually insert the license plate number in order to help the recognition algorithm
  				\item The system must be able to retrieve the license plate of the vehicle running an algorithm to recognise it
  				\item The system must be able to verify that the license plate number is valid and registered to a vehicle
  				\item The system must require the user to specify the type of violation

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	The system should ensure acceptable response times in the interactions with the user, which strictly depends on the number of concurrent users and the connection speed.
\newline
The processes of providing data and loading the map of safe and unsafe areas shouldn't be too slow.
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
	\subsubsection{Availability}
	The system must be available 99,9\% of the time (up to 8,76 hours per year of downtime). The system should be accessible 24 hours per day.
	\subsubsection{Security}
	Users personal information and payment information are encrypted and must be protected during transmission, as already stated the PTPP protocol will be used to ensure encryption through the network.
	Restricted access APIs must check that who tries to use them is actually allowed to do so.
	\subsubsection{Portability}
	The system must be also accessible by the most common mobile platforms (iOS and Android devices).
